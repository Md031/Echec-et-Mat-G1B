# This section is inspired by the work of famous polish chess player Tomasz Michniewski 
# The idea is to create tables that represent the value of a type of piece in the board given its position

PIECE_VALUES = [None, 100, 300, 300, 500, 900, 0]   #maps out the values of the pieces. 
                                                    # by default in the chess library these are the values chess.PAWN = 1, chess.KNIGHT= 2, chess.BISHOP= 3, chess.ROOK= 4, chess.QUEEN= 5, chess.KING= 6
                                                    #this is why the index 0 is None
                                                    #We can get then simply get the value of a piece with PIECE_VALUES[piece.piece_type] 


# a pawn is basically a lot stronger in the middle since chess is about controlling the center and the board, and the closer it gets to promotion the higher the value
